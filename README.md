# Overview
This coursework aims to assess my understanding of database technologies and their application in storing and processing high-frequency finance data. It consists of three parts, each focusing on different aspects of database management and usage.

+ Part I: Comparing SQL and NoSQL
In this part, I compared SQL and NoSQL databases, particularly in the context of high-frequency finance data storage and processing. I highlighted key differences and discuss their implications within the given word limit.

- Part II: Database Design and Implementation
For this part, I designed and implemented a database to store high-frequency tick data from the London Stock Exchange. I have the flexibility to choose any database management system and must document the steps taken, accompanied by screenshots of corresponding outputs. Pre-processing and cleaning of the data to address inconsistencies and anomalies are also expected.

- Part III: Python Database Connection 
In the final part, I wrote a Python script to connect to the database created in Part II and perform some operations, such as executing queries or counting the number of cancelled orders.
